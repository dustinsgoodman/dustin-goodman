title: Things I Wish I Knew When I Was Learning To Code
---

1. Before you learn to code, think about what you want to code
2. There’s nothing mystical about it
3. It never works the first time [And probably won’t the second or third time]
4. Someone will always tell you you’re doing it wrong
5. Someone will always tell you you’re not a real coder
6. Worrying about “geek cred” will slowly kill you
7. Sticking with it is more important than the method
