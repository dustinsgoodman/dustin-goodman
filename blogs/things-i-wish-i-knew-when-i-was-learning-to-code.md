title: Things I Wish I Knew When I Was Learning To Code
---

1. Before you learn to code, think about what you want to code
  * What do you like to do for fun / what are your personal interests? Music? Sports? Video games? Movies? Film? Health? Computer science intersects with each of these fields
    * The list comes from extracurriculars from high school. However, I'm not assuming the audience for this post is teens.
    * The list needs to be equally friendly to boys and girls, right now it leans more to boys
    * CS is different from coding. CS is a way of thinking, coding is a way of implementing your imagination
  * Personal anecdote about how you connected technology with something you love

2. There’s nothing mystical about it
  * Coding is like cooking; you first gather a list of ingredients, and then combine them to create something cool. For coding, the ingredients are a programming language's syntax/API/etc and you combine them together by writing a program that does something useful
    * Oversimplification?
    * Staying away from data structures and algorithms
  * The websites (eg Google) you visit every day, the apps (eg Facebook) you use every day, these things surrounding us everyday, etc are big programs written by combining ingredients together
  * You can create equally cool and useful stuff if you learn the ingredients
  * So coding is not some big/intimidating thing; it's something that you can learn; all it takes is a little curiosity

3. (?) How do you get started
  * Start weaving in Codecademy's products from this paragraph onwards

3. It never works the first time [And probably won’t the second or third time]

4. Someone will always tell you you’re doing it wrong

5. Someone will always tell you you’re not a real coder

6. Worrying about “geek cred” will slowly kill you
  * Is this paragraph necessary?

7. Sticking with it is more important than the method
