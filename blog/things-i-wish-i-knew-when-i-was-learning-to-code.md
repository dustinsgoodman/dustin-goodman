title: Things I Wish I Knew When I Was Learning To Code
published: false
---

You've started on this journey of learning to program. One day, you'll probably look back and think about a few things you wish you knew now that you currently don't know. Every programmer does it, and the list is different for every programmer. This is our list of things we wish we knew before we started to learn to program.

### Have an end goal in mind when starting the learning process (1&3)
As you can see just from our [list of tracks](http://codecademy.com/learn), there are several choices for where you can start your learning process. In fact, there are even more languages and possiblities than what we offer. The trick is deciding what you want to code before learning to code. Personally, I took CS101 because of my love of technology. I thought it would be nice to learn how all my favorite software was built. I ended up falling in love with programming and am now trying to learn everything I can in order to become a better teacher because I believe there are issues with the education system.

### There isn't anything magical about it (2)
You might hear your elders say that all these websites are created using some "magic". In reality, programming is just a combination of logic statements and mathematics. Think about coding in terms of cooking. First, you gather a list of ingredients and then combine them to create something else. In programming, the ingredients are a language's syntaxes and APIs which you combine together to create a useful program. Websites you visit every day (Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) are examples of big programs written by combining several ingredients together. You can create equally cool and useful stuff once you understand all the ingredients. Hence, coding is not some big, intimidating thing, but rather, it's something that you can learn.

### It rarely works at first, but try and try and try again (4)
This is going to be true throughout your process no matter how much experience you have. Your first attempt will be valient as will your second and third attempts, but you usually will do something wrong. This isn't a bad thing. In fact, the best learning tool is making mistakes. Why? So you can learn from them. If you never make a mistake, you'll probably miss out on some important lessons about learning a language and its syntaxes. Don't be afraid to make a mistake.

### Don't listen to negative criticism (5-7)

### "I think I can, I think I can" (8)


----------

1. Before you learn to code, think about what you want to code
  * What do you like to do for fun / what are your personal interests? Music? Sports? Video games? Movies? Film? Health? Computer science intersects with each of these fields
    * The list comes from extracurriculars from high school. However, I'm not assuming the audience for this post is teens.
    * The list needs to be equally friendly to boys and girls, right now it leans more to boys
    * CS is different from coding. CS is a way of thinking, coding is a way of implementing your imagination
  * Personal anecdote about how you connected technology with something you love

2. There’s nothing mystical about it
  * Coding is like cooking; you first gather a list of ingredients, and then combine them to create something cool. For coding, the ingredients are a programming language's syntax/API/etc and you combine them together by writing a program that does something useful
    * Oversimplification?
    * Staying away from data structures and algorithms
  * The websites (eg Google) you visit every day, the apps (eg Facebook) you use every day, these things surrounding us everyday, etc are big programs written by combining ingredients together
  * You can create equally cool and useful stuff if you learn the ingredients
  * So coding is not some big/intimidating thing; it's something that you can learn; all it takes is a little curiosity

3. (?) How do you get started
  * Start weaving in Codecademy's products from this paragraph onwards

4. It never works the first time [And probably won’t the second or third time]

5. Someone will always tell you you’re doing it wrong

6. Someone will always tell you you’re not a real coder

7. Worrying about “geek cred” will slowly kill you
  * Is this paragraph necessary?

8. Sticking with it is more important than the method
